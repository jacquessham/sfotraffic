# SFO Passenger Traffic Prediction

This is a project to analyze the passenger traffic in San Francisco International Airport (SFO). We are going to drill in the insight of the passenger traffic in SFO and make prediction of the passenger traffic in different period of time. This project was originally conducted in 2019, which is now the Part 1 of this project. Because of the 2020-2021 Pandemic disrupted the global passenger traffic, the prediction is not valid anymore. Therefore, I have restructed this project and start an effort to follow up the project (Part 1) for the passenger traffic after the pandemic is over.

## Data
The data set is an open source data set obtained from <a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">Open SF</a>. In the [Data Folder](/Data), it consists all original data sets, transformed data sets, and ETL scripts for all parts of this project.

## Part 1
Part 1 was the original work conducted in 2019. The primary goal of this project was to make prediction of passenger traffic between 2018-2019 with 2005-2017 data. Besides that, I have also compared the prediction accuracy between the packages available in R and Facebook Prophet (Which is the newly released time-series statistical-learning package in 2019). You may find more detail in the the [Part 1](/Part1) folder.

## Part 1.1
Part 1.1 follows up the Part 1 with updated code in Python. Coming Soon...

## Part 2
Part 2 is the effort to follow up the disruption of 2020-2021 Pandemic to predict the growth pattern of the passenger traffic once the pandemic is over. Coming Soon...
