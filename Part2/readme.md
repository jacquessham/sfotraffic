# Part 2 - Predict Passenger Traffic in SFO after the 2020-2021 Pandemic
Part 2 is the effort to follow up the disruption of 2020-2021 Pandemic to predict the growth pattern of the passenger traffic once the pandemic is over using the latest data available. In this part, I will achieve the goals using Python.

## About the Data Set
The data set is an open source data set obtained from <a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">Open SF</a>. It consists of 12 columns with XX,XXX observations. For the convenience, the data set is cleansed and transformed for this part in the ETL process with <i>etl_2020.py</i>. The ETL process returns 2 csv files, <i>sfo2020pax_eda.csv</i> for EDA and <i>sfo2020pax_month.csv</i> for model training. You may find more detail about the original data set, transformed data sets, and the ETL scripts in the [Data Folder](../Data). The data set is a time series data, and therefore, there are constraints to what we can do as some approches may violate some assumptions on certain algorithms, such as linear regression.

## Goal
The goal of this part of the project is to utilize the data set to predict the passenger traffic pattern until the passenger traffic level is return to pre-pandemic level (2019).
