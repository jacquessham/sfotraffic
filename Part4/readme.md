## Instruction
### Initiation
First, initiate GoodData.CN and Postgres database via Docker with the following command:

```
sh initate.sh
```

<br>
GoodData.CN may take some time to set up. Once GoodData.CN and Postgres are setup,
run the following command:

```
sh setup_sfodb.sh
```

<br>
By running this script, it will automatically set up the data pipeline ingest, load, and transform the data to the output stage, and set up the workspace in GoodData. Once it is done, you may get to GoodData.CN's <i>SFO Staistics</i> workspace.
