# Part 3 - Predict Cargo Traffic in SFO
We would like to look into the insights on Cargo traffic in SFO after conducting some analytics on passenger traffic. We will be using the cargo tonnage data from Open SF.

## About the data set
The data set is an open source data set obtained from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org">Open SF</a>. It consists of 12 columns with 55,542 observations, and you may find more detail about the data set in the [Data Folder](/Data).

## Goal and Plan
The goal of this part of the project is to utilize the data set to predict cargo tonnage in the next 2 years in the future. In order to do this, we will take the following steps to achieve our goal:

<ol>
	<li>Data Cleansing</li>
	<li>EDA</li>
	<li>Model Training</li>
	<li>Model Validation</li>
	<li>Prediction</li>
</ol>

Coming soon...

## EDA
Before we start prediction the cargo tonnage, we will look into the dataset and try to discover some insights with the cargo traffic trend. You may learn more about the trend in the [EDA folder](EDA).

## Prediction
