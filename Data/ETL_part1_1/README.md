# ETL for Part 1.1

The purpose of the ETL script is to transform the original data sets to 2 data sets for EDA and predictive model training as the original data is a transactional data set. 

## Files
The file <i>etl_part1_1.py</i> transforms the original data set into <i>sfopax_eda.csv</i> and <i>sfopax_month.csv</i>, which is the data sets for EDA and predictive model training, respectively, in the [Data folder](../).

## Transformation
Coming soon...
