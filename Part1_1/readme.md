# Part 1.1 SFO Passenger Traffic Prediction (2018-2019)/Version 2

Part 1.1 follows up the Part 1 with updated code in Python. We have a data set on SFO traffic between July, 2005 and Decemeber, 2017. It includes the passenger counts on each airline every month in the given period. I have two goals for this project:
<ol>
	<li>Visualize the data set for EDA purpose</li>
	<li>Predict the passenger traffic and growth rate in 2018 and 2019</li>
</ol>
<br>
This part differs with Part 1 is to make prediction of passenger traffic between 2018-2019 with 2005-2017 data but using Python only. The EDA is also redone with Python packages instead of ggplot in R. 

## About the data set
The data set is an open source data set obtained from <a href="https://datasf.org/opendata/">Open SF</a>. It consists of 12 columns with 17,959 observations. For the convenience, the data set is cleansed and transformed for this part in the ETL process. The ETL process returns 2 csv files, 1 for EDA and 1 for model training. You may find more detail about the original data set, transformed data sets, and the ETL scripts in the [Data Folder](../Data).

## Goal and Plan
The goal of this part of the project is to utilize the data set to predict the passenger traffic between 2018-2019 in SFO. In order to do this, we will take the following steps to achieve our goal:<br>
<ol>
	<li>Data Cleansing</li>
	<li>EDA</li>
	<li>Model Training</li>
	<li>Model Validation</li>
	<li>Prediction</li>
</ol>

## EDA
The data set consists of data between 2005 and 2017. Before we build the predictive model, we shall understand more about the insights about the data set. You may learn more about the data set in the [EDA folder](/EDA).
